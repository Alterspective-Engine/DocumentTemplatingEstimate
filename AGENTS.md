# AI Agent Development Guidelines for EstimateDoc

This document has been consolidated into the shared guidelines:

- Shared standards: `docs/AI-AGENTS-GUIDELINES.md`
- UI/UX reference: `UI.md`

Agent-specific guidance (e.g., prompt structures for Claude) remains in agent docs:

- Claude specifics: `CLAUDE.md`

Whatâ€™s inside the shared guidelines:
- TypeScript-only requirements, SOLID/DRY/clean code, organization, error handling
- No-orphaned-files policy and navigation requirements/checklists
- Data accuracy rules (no mock data, no hard-coded values, validation, transparency)
- Testing, documentation, security, performance, and version control standards
- File cleanup protocol and a full quality checklist

Always follow the shared guidelines above. Agent-specific docs add to these rules but never replace them.
