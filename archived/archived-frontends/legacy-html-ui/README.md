These files are archived legacy standalone HTML pages previously used for demonstration:

- index.html
- dashboard.html
- template-browser.html
- data-evidence.js

They are not part of the application and must not be modified for new features. All UI work should be implemented in the React SPA under `estimatedoc-dashboard/client` following the architecture in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
